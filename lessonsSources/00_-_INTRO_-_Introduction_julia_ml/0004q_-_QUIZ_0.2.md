### Q1: What is ML?

Which could be considered examples of Machine Learning ?

```@example q0001

choices = [ # hide
  "An international team on oncologist has reviewes the empirical evidence on breast cancer and produced a decision support tool for practitioners that prescribes the best medical act to take on patients based on chemical, biological and istological characteristics of the tissues and the patient genetic, physical and medical condition", # hide
  "Your content provider suggests you the films it thinks you may like based on the films that you have already decided to watch and the review given by the other users that have viewing behaviours similar to yours", # hide
  "Your phone automatically compose a video by selecting the most beutiful photos", # hide, # hide
  "Your preferred photo editor tool function to cartonise your photos", # hide

To be considered ML, an algorithm must learn the solution of the problem from the data.
In the oncologist example, it is humans that defines the outcomes, even if this decision is data-driven.
Similarly, in the photo editor, the parameters of the filters that are applied (convoluted) to the photo to cartonise it (or making whatever other effect) are not learn by the algorithm itself but explicitly engineered. We will see in the `NN` unit how this contrast with Convolutional Neural Networks, where the weights of these filters are instead learn.

The correct answer are:
  - Your content provider suggests you the films it thinks you may like based on the films that you have already decided to watch and the review given by the other users that have viewing behaviours similar to yours
  - Your phone automatically compose a video by selecting the most beutiful photos
