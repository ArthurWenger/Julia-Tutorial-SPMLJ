## Objectives 

This course aims to provide a general initialisation to Julia, a modern, expressive and efficient programming language, and introduce the main concepts around machine learning, together with some algorithms and practical implementations of machine learning workflows.

In particular the objectives are : 
1. Supply students with an operational knowledge of a modern and efficient general-purpose language that can be employed for the implementation of their research daily activities;
2. Present several specific but commonly used tools in multiple scientific areas (data transformation, optimisation,...)
3. Introducing students to modern tools for scientific collaboration and software quality, such as version control systems and best practices to obtain replicable results.
4. Introduce machine learning approaches: scopes, terminology, typologies, workflow organisation
5. Introduce some specific machine learning algorithms for classification and regression

## Organisation

The course is multi-channel, with these pages complemented with youtube videos (see [`Program`](@ref) ), quizzes and exercises. Thanks to projects as [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) and [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) the source of most of these pages are runnable valid Julia files.

**To fully master the subject, nothing is better than cloning [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sylvaticus/SPMLJ) and run these pages by yourself!**
To execute yourself the code discussed in the videos run the code in the `lessonsSource` folder.
Other resources used in the course (in particular the examples of the introduciton and the exercises) are located under the `lessonsMaterial` folder.

Note that there will be a bit of incongruence in the terminology used for "units". Sometimes I call them "lessons", especially at the beginning of the course, then it ended up that the actual content was much bigger than a standard "lesson", so I started to use the word "unit".
Any-how, the course is organised in units/lessons (e.g. `JULIA1`). Each unit/lesson has its own Julia environment and it is organised in several _segments_. These are the individual pages on this site and correspond to a single file in the github repository. Then each segment is divised in multiple videos, that I call _parts_.

I am a Forest and Natural Resources Economist @ AgroParisTech, a French "Grand ecole" (sort of polytecnic university) in the life science domain and affiliated to BETA, the _Bureau d'Économie Théorique et Appliquée_, which brings together most of the economists located in the _Grand-Est_ region of France.
My main interest is in exploring the interplay between the biophysical layers in the forest sector (climate change, forest dynamics) and the socio-economic ones (individual forest owners behaviours, timber markets "behaviours") in order to better understand the space of actions that society has to maximise social benefits in a sustenible way. For that I design, develop and use bio-economic simulation models of the forest sector.

While this course is in English, English is not my native language.. please, be understanding !
