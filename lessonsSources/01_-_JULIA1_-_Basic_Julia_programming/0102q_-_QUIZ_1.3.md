### Q1: Passing functions as argument to other functions (callbacks)

Which is the output of the following snippet?:

```julia
foo(x)     = x+1
boo(x)     = x+2
zoo(foo,x) = foo(x) + 1
zoo.(boo,[1,2,3])
```

```@example q0103

choices = [ # hide
    "An error during parsing of the code", # hide
    "A run-time error", # hide
    "The vector `[3,4,5]`", # hide
    "The vector `[4,5,6]`", # hide
    "The value `12`", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [4]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

The code first defines two functions, `foo` and `boo`, then it defines the function `zoo` whose first parameter is a function object and then it calls the function with the function `boo` and the value `1`. It doesn't matter that the argument name is `foo` like the `foo` function, that is only a local variable within the `zoo` function. What is actually passed (as an object) is the `boo` function, so that is the one what will be used to evaluate the result.
Note that functions in Julia are [Fist-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) of the language: they can be passed as arguments to other functions (as done here), returned by other functions, assigned as objects to any identifier or stored in data structures.

The correct answer is:
  - The vector `[4,5,6]`

### Q2: Effects of different way of copying objects

Given the following snippet:

```julia
foo       = [[1,2],3]
goo       = foo[1]
goo[1]    = 10
zoo       = copy(foo)
zoo[1][1] = foo[1][1]+10
zoo[1]    = 100
doo       = deepcopy(foo)
doo[1]    = foo[1][1]+100
```

Which is the value of `doo[1]` ?

```@example q0103

numericq(120)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The object "stored" as first element of the array `foo` is assigned to the name binding `goo` too. It is hence the same object that is mutated in the third line command. `zoo` creates a new array object, but this different object store the same object as first element. `zoo[1][1] = foo[1][1]+10` hence mutates itself (it is equivalent to `zoo[1][1] += 10`), while the following line reassignes the first element of the (independent) array referenced by `zoo` to an other totally different object (an integer). `foo[1][1]` hence is first mutated to `10` using `goo` and then is further increased of `10` using `zoo`. When used to compute the value of `doo[1]` it is hence `120`.

The correct answer is: 120
