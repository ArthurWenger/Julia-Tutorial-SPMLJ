### Q1: Missingness

Which of the following questions is correct ?

```@example q0102

choices = [ # hide
    "A given variable should be assigned `Missing` when some data we know to exists but we don't know its value", # hide
    "A function whose one of the parameter is `nothing` should return `nothing` as well", # hide
    "A function whose one of the parameter is `Nothing` should return `Nothing` as well", # hide
    "A function whose one of the parameter is `missing` should return an error when called", # hide
    "A function whose one of the parameter is `Missing` should return an error when called", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct",] # hide    
answers = [7]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide
```

`Missing` and `Nothing` are the name of the types of the singleton instances `missing` and `nothing` respectively. The former (`missing`) is used to signal the missingness of information concerning some data, and propagates silently (i.e., without generating an error) across function calls, the latter (`nothing`) instead should never appear as argument of a function, so to raise an error if indeed it appears. So none of the above sentences is true. Note that this is how `nothing` and `missing` are intended to be used, and the way they are used across Julia base and all the most used packages, but "nothing" ( :) ) forbids you to implement a custom function to process a `nothing` or `missing` value.

The correct answers are:
  - "None of the (other) sentences is correct"

### Q2: Stochasticity

Given that after running the following code:

```julia
myRNG = MersenneTwister(123)
a1  = rand(myRNG,10:100,3)
a2  = rand(myRNG,10:100,3)
myRNG = MersenneTwister(123)
b1  = rand(myRNG,10:1000,2)
b2  = rand(myRNG,10:100,4)
```

You end up with:

```julia
- a1 = [97,42,?₁]
- a2 = [?₂,?₃,?₄]
- b1 = [959,364]
- b2 = [34,54,67,56]
```

Which is the sum of `?₁ + ?₂ + ?₃ + ?₄` ?

```@example q0102
numericq(211)  # hide
```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The flow of random numbers in the two sets of commands (`a1` and `a2` vs. `b1` and `b2`) must be the same, as both follow the initialization of the random number generator with the same fixed seed, little matter if they are scaled over a 10:100 or 10:1000 range. From the provided information we know that the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th values, scaled over the 10:100 range, are respectivelly `34`, `54`, `67` and `56`. so `?1` (the third value in the first flow of random numbers) must be also `34` and `a2` must be `[54,67,56]`. The sum is then `211`

The correct answers is: `211`
