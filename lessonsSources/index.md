### Acknowledgements

The Julia part of this course is for the most a reworking, updating and extension of the [Julia Concise Tutorial](https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/).
The ML part takes heavy inspiration from the MITx_6.86x course "[_Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning_](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to)" of Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola and Karene Chu.

The implementation is based on a stack of very flexible documentation packages for Julia, namely [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl), [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and [QuizQuestions.jl](https://github.com/jverzani/QuizQuestions.jl) package and, for the ML algorithms, of the [BetaML.jl](https://github.com/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl) package.
Hosting of these pages and of the relative source and automatic building of the pages from source is thanks to GitHub.

Financial acknowledgements are reported under each author in the [authors section](00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0001_-_Course_presentation.html#Course-authors).
