### Acknowledgements

The Julia part of this course is for the most a reworking, updating and extension of the [Julia Concise Tutorial](https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/).
The ML part takes heavy inspiration from the MITx_6.86x course _[Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to)_ of Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola and Karene Chu.

The implementation is based on a stack of very flexible documentation packages for Julia, namely [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl), [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) and [QuizQuestions.jl](https://github.com/jverzani/QuizQuestions.jl) package and, for the ML algorithms, of the [BetaML.jl](https://github.com/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl) package.
Hosting of these pages and of the relative source and automatic building of the pages from source are courtesy of GitHub. Videos are hosted on YouTube. 

Financial acknowledgements are reported under each author in the [authors section](00_-_INTRO_-_Introduction_julia_ml/0001_-_Course_presentation.html#Course-authors).
