    "# Here we define 2 [`DenseLayer`](@ref) where, for each of them, we specify the number of neurons in input (the first layer being equal to the dimensions of the data), the output layer (for a classification task, the last layer output size beying equal to the number of classes) and an _activation function_ for each layer (default the `identity` function).\n",
